In December, I received a query over e-mail asking if I accept foreign posts on my website. I never thought of that before. I started blogging because I wanted to try what writing was all about and whether I would enjoy it at all.

I replied in that spirit. Before they added me to their database, they also wanted a price for which I would consider publishing the content. This post is my thirty-fourth post. Most of them have a relatively low readership but about four posts attracted much more. So far, two of them bring to the site tens of thousands of people per month. I engage with my readers regularly in discussions below the posts. Naturally, the value of a website in search engines goes up.

## What's the price of a blog?
Although I am aware of the above facts, I don't know how to estimate the reasonable value for publishing a foreign post. Since I didn't have a concrete offer yet, I said I'd be willing to consider it for $100-200.

It didn't take long, and I received a specific offer to publish a post written to fit my site. The terms were simple:
- I should publish the text unchanged
- The post should not be marked as an Ad
- It should be indexed by Google search engine
- And, finally, I should send an invoice



That's it. It was only with a specific offer that I began to think about what I would do. I had no idea at the time. [I asked][fb-query] my friends on Facebook. I wondered if the blog would sink in their eyes and if they would perceive it as if I became a sellout.

I received several answers. My friends think that there is nothing wrong with asking money for my work. However, as one of them pointed out, he would no longer accept such an offer. He makes his living from selling his own products. This thought stuck in my head as I went outside for a walk.

## Should I accept the offer or not?
I had a few hours to think. I considered the pros and cons. Some of my friends advised me to take the offer, even though they didn't know how much it was. Others told me to let it go. But the decision was mine.

The post they sent me was not bad. But unlike my other texts, it would stick out. It was written too superficially, and included many bullet points. Also, I did not fully agree with the content. It was about Apple devices that I don't use and more or less ignore.

I thought like this: if I nod to this offer now, what will happen next? Will more foreign posts follow? How many of my posts should I write to balance-out one Ad post? If I start publishing too much non-original content, the value of the webpage will start sinking.

In the end, I came to the conclusion that I didn't want foreign content on my site. No matter how imperfect it is, it's all mine. I built it from scratch and I'm probably doing a decent job, as people are visiting it regularly. I like that I'm the only author. I don't have my own products yet but I'm already working on them. While I invested solely into my site to this point, I can continue to do so.

In this spirit, I wrote down the offer and thankfully rejected it.

## The end?
I thought that was the end of it. But the communication did not stop. They wanted to know the reasons for which I rejected the offer. I said I don't want third-party content on my site. I didn't think of it until the offer came but I'm clear on that. However, they offered me an alternative. They are willing to pay me the same amount if I publish a link to their website with a short anchor text. The condition was that the post needs to have a current date. I refused to change the publication date of existing posts but I offered to write a new post and publish it. This post you're currently reading is the Ad post. The link they requested to publish is now part of this story, and it's no longer an Ad taken out of context. It's fine by me now.

*Update 01/24/2021: After a few days, I got a response to my post from the client. They were not satisfied with this type of text. I am retracting the link from this post as requested.*

## What's next?
I'm not going to publish foreign content, I'm already clear on that. If an offer comes to publish an inconspicuous link to another website, I will assess each offer individually. And I believe that over time I will have my own products that will earn me the needed resources to run this website. Follow me and I will definitely keep you in the loop.
